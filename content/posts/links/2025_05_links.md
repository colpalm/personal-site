Links from June 2025.

<!--more-->

1. [GitHub issues is _almost_ the best notebook in the world.](https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/26/notes/)
    - Interesting workflow.
2. [Why I have slightly longer timelines than some of my guests](https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/timelines-june-2025)
    - Kind of funny that 7 years counts as a long timeline now. The bottleneck is continuous learning. No 
      matter how good your prompt is, LLMs are significantly handicapped because they basically reset to zero in 
      every new session.
3. [A Bear Case: My Predictions Regarding AI Progress](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/oKAFFvaouKKEhbBPm/a-bear-case-my-predictions-regarding-ai-progress)
    - LLMs aren't going to get us there, but similar to above, the bear case is still close — 5 to 15 years out.
4. [Biotech companies I wish existed](https://blog.eladgil.com/p/biotech-companies-i-wish-existed)
    - Makes you think.
5. [Moses streaming the Exodus](https://x.com/TrungTPhan/status/1931741470991777840)
6. [The Claude Bliss Attractor](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/the-claude-bliss-attractor)
7. [The Way of Code](https://www.thewayofcode.com)
