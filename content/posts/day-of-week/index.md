What is the best day off during the week to have? Lets look at each day. We'll start with the easy ones to rule out.

## Mid Week Days are No Good
- Tuesday
- Wednesday
- Thursday

Although an extra day off during midweek is nice and may break up the week, its hard to enjoy it. If I have Tuesday off,
I am presumably working Monday. By the time work wraps up on Monday, do I have time to do something Monday night to take advantage
of the day off tomorrow? Maybe, but maybe not. Then I'm off on Tuesday (yay!). But I have to work on Wednesday, so 
do I get to enjoy it or am I thinking about work the next day? Maybe, maybe not. The same logic applies to Wednesday and Thursday.

## So Friday or Monday
We've narrowed it down to the bookends of the weekend but I'd argue which bookend is important. Friday has good vibes no matter what. Even
Thursday has pretty good vibes since its almost Friday. Adding a Friday off gives you the extra day
but doesn't do much mentally. 

Monday on the other hand...Everyone knows the classic line:

When you get Monday off, you get the three-day weekend and the added benefit of missing Monday. Then, when you start on Tuesday, 
you already have a head start on the week.

So clearly, the correct day is Monday. QED

###### Caveats

- Tuesday and Thursday could work if you take the additional Monday or Friday off, respectively to a 4-day weekend,
but then we're adding more time off.
- If you work 4-day work weeks by default, this analysis does not apply. Friday or Monday will work.
