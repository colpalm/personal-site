My name is Colin Palmer, and I am a software engineer with roots in the biotech industry.

Before becoming a software engineer, I worked as a development scientist at a biotech company, building clinical
reagents critical for diagnosing sick patients. 

Since moving fully into tech, my focus has evolved from general web development to specialized roles in
data analytics and machine learning. Notably, I've helped develop a data analytics platform for the IRS and lead 
AI integration projects through Booz Allen Hamilton's AI Investments division, integrating [aiSSEMBLE](https://github.com/boozallen/aissemble)
into various client initiatives.

This website is a collection of posts/essays on topics I find interesting, along with highlights from my personal projects.

Originally from Los Angeles, I spent the first three decades of my life in Southern California. After spending the last few
years "surviving" the East Coast winters in the Washington D.C. area (D.C winters are not mild if your baseline is LA), 
I am finally looking to return home.

### Career Opportunities
I'm actively seeking software engineering and machine learning roles in the Los Angeles and Orange County areas. While
I'd love to return to the promised land, I'm also open to opportunities in other prominent tech hubs (Bay Area, San Diego,
New York City, Austin, etc.) if the role aligns with my expertise and interests. Please feel free to reach out via the 
contact information below if you know of an opportunity or would like to connect.

Additionally, since I entered SWE from a non-traditional background, I'm always happy to connect with others
navigating a similar path. Whether you're seeking advice or simply want to chat about career transitions, machine learning
or anything else software engineering related, feel free to reach out.

### Consulting and Freelance Work
I'm available for consulting and freelance projects, specifically those focused on data science and machine learning. 
If you have a project that requires guidance to move from concept to production, you can get in touch with the contact information
