My name is Colin Palmer, and I am a software engineer with roots in the biotech industry.

Before transitioning into software engineering, I worked as a development scientist at a biotech company, building clinical
reagents critical for diagnosing sick patients. 

Since transitioning fully into tech, my focus has evolved from general web application development to specialized roles in
data analytics and machine learning. Notably, I've helped develop a data analytics platform for the IRS and lead 
AI integration projects through Booz Allen Hamilton's AI Investments division, integrating [aiSSEBMLE](https://github.com/boozallen/aissemble)
into various client initiatives.

Originally from Los Angeles, I spent the first three decades of my life in Southern California. After surviving the last few years on
the East Coast in the Washington D.C. area, I am enthusiastically looking to return home — where the ocean meets the mountains
and winter is a brisk 65°F.

### Career Opportunities
I'm actively seeking software engineering and machine learning roles in the Los Angeles and Orange County areas. While
I'd love to return to the promised land, I'm also open to opportunities in other prominent tech hubs (Bay Area, San Diego,
New York City, Austin, etc.) if the role aligns with my expertise and interests. Please feel free to reach out via the 
contact information below if you know of an opportunity or would like to connect.

### Consulting and Freelance Work
I'm available for consulting and freelance projects, specifically those focused on data science and machine learning. 
If you have a project that requires guidance to move from concept to production, please feel free to reach out.
